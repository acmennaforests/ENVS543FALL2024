# ENVS 543 FALL2024

envs 543 repo fall 2024

editing it 3 weeks after the due date

going through all the presentations from Dr. Dyer's Canvas website

But also reading R for Data Science to give myself a second source to look to.

Anyways, this repo will be utilized for the whole semester, hopefully I'll have some cool forest data on here
