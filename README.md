# ENVS 543 FALL2024

envs 543 repo fall 2024

Anyways, this repo will be utilized for the whole semester, hopefully I'll have some cool forest data on here

Will be using this repository to analyze data for my non-thesis master's project

Note to self, there is some lag

Let's see if I can push this back to Rstudio
