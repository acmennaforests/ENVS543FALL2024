## Graphics

This assignment asks for graphics in classic plotting and ggplot2 of the following information

1.  Total Rain for Each Weekday in January. Â 

2.  Average daily temperature for weekdays in February.

3.  Water depth on Valentine's Day.

4.  Scatter plot of Daily Total Rain and Daily Median Temperature grouped by month (label the centroid of months).

5.  Wind Direction during the week containing the 8th of January.

## Running Code

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)

#install the libraries needed to plot and graph the above info

```

Now let's get to the graphing component:

1.  graphing for the total rain for each weekday in January (requires a line graph)

```{r}

#classic graphing
get_rice_data()


#ggplot2



```

2.  graphing for average daily temperature for weekdays in February

```{r}

```
